Silly Keys v0.2

thank you for using silly keys!
to use start making keys, please join our discord.
use the /register command to register your script.
you will get a script id in your dms.
with the script id, you can create keys using /generate to give to your users.
don't worry. only you can make keys for your script id.
if you need help, please do not hesitate to dm one of the developers.

remember, keys are hwid based.
so you can laugh at the people who try to share their key.
