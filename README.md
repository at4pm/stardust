## Security & Privacy
Your security and privacy is our #1 priority. We have put so many measures in place to keep your scripts safe. (good luck bypassing this, @kynok)
- Encrypted **and** encoded API responses + requests
- Checker obfuscation
- Discarding of script after execution
- API blocked from web clients

This is just to name the big ones.

## Instructions
Here is how to use Stardust
1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GQbgKAMJad) and register your script.
2. Replace the contents of your script with the contents of [our script](https://github.com/at4pm/stardust/blob/main/script.lua).

> [!TIP]
> You can remove the comment in the script. That is just first time information.

Your done! Make keys using your Script ID and distribute our script with your key. We will handle the rest.
